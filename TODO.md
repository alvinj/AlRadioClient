To-Do List
==========

* Add a doc and usage video
* Toggle the Play/Pause button appropriately
* Add an 'Off' switch, which would shut down the system
* Make the buttons larger and better-looking
* Change the color and/or shape of the buttons to indicate what is currently playing
* Can I get the current volume state when the web app starts? That would help when
  I access the system from multiple browsers
* Add buttons/links to show log files
